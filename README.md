# Linux Remote Desktop
## VDI that's based on Linux Containers

This project creates a secure, open source, multi-tenant VDI environment for remote work.
Users in your organization can access a remote Linux OS based desktop, run applications, as well as access other important resources. The remote environment is based on a docker container, is efficient and scalable, and can be deployed to an unlimited number of users. A web admin control panel is available to allow admins to control the organization's environment.

The project is based on many open source projects, such as:
 - [xrdp](https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp) - an open source RDP server
 - [Apache Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/) -  clientless remote desktop gateway
 - [Nubo](https://nubosoftware.com/) - Secure remote environment 
 - [Ubuntu Xrdp](https://github.com/danielguerra69/ubuntu-xrdp) - multi user remote desktop Server in docker container.
